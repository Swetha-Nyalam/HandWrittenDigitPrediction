# Handwritten Digit Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of building and training a neural network to predict handwritten digits using the popular MNIST dataset. The notebook is structured to guide you through the necessary steps, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Visualization**: Utilizes `matplotlib` and `sklearn` to load and visualize the MNIST dataset, making it easier to understand the characteristics of the data involved.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepares the image data for model input, ensuring that the data is in the proper format for the neural network.
- **Building a Neural Network**: Employs PyTorch to construct a neural network that can learn to recognize and predict handwritten digits.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Focuses on training the model effectively and using accuracy metrics to evaluate its performance, ensuring that the model learns accurately and efficiently.
